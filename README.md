## Local development

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (or create one) and fill in the required Discord credentials.
- To enable the Redis-backed queue cache, start a Redis instance and set `REDIS_URI` (for example, run `docker compose up redis` to use the bundled configuration).
- If `REDIS_URI` is omitted, Aqukin now skips connecting to Redis and falls back to in-memory state for the current process.
- The Graylog transport is optional; leave `LOGGER_URL` unset to disable remote log forwarding during local runs. When enabled, repeated delivery failures automatically pause the transport for a few minutes to keep the console readable.
